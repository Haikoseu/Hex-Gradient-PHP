# Hex-Gradient-PHP
A PHP adaptation of the original Python program (https://github.com/Haikoseu/Hex-Gradient-PY).

With this tool, you can generate a color gradient in hexadecimal code, for which you can choose the arrival and departure colors, as well as the length.

You are free to make your own CSS to make it as pretty as possible.
